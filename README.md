# Speakout-Android
Have/Know a mute person? Well, this app allows you to type in a text and have your device speak it out aloud to whoever cares to listen. Basically, it is just a TextToSpeech app I thought up and coded in a night for fun.

I hope to get time to update it with features and graphics later.
